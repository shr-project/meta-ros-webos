# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

`meta-ros-webos` is the OpenEmbedded layer for interfacing between `meta-ros`
and webOS OSE.

As of 2020-07-01, this branch can be used to build the February and March 2020
releases of ROS 2 **dashing** and **eloquent** and ROS 1 **melodic**, for
webOS OSE 2.5 on Ubuntu **bionic**. Multiple sublayers must be used. See
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions)
for instructions.
